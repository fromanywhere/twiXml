# What is this?

This is an experiment about parse twitter feed not using Twitter APIm which was changed, but using [Yandex](http://yandex.ru) blogsearch API.

Currently Yandex export result of twitter search by valid XML format, so I try to make usable JS plugin for universal feed embedding to any website.

I use *jQuery 1.9.x* as a service library.
